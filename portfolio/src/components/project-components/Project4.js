        <p><i>Ultimate Urban Dictionary</i> is a fun application that allows users to search for trendy and/or slang words to find their definitions as well as a corresponding gif. This app came out of a group project that I worked on in my coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech. Our idea for the app was to help un-cool folks (such as ourselves) learn some hip new lingo! Using Giphy and Urban Dictionary API, this project adds a whole new dimension to the idea of an online dictionary.

        <h3 className='mt-4'>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          This was truly a collaborative effort from start to finish. I helped to define the project and its aesthetic working with CSS and Bootstrap. I also assisted with the front-end logic during the development phase by reviewing code and testing its functionality.
